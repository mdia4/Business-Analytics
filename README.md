# Comparing Baltimore and Fairfax Household Income and Graduation Rates
### The goal of this project was to use 'Opportunity Atlas' data in order to compare household income and graduation rates as aggregated by race in Fairfax and Baltimore areas. In doing so, the project found large income disparities for households of different racial groups in both areas, disparities which translated into lower graduation rates for poor families (which were usually from black or brown racial demographics.)
